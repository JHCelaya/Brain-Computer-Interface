# Brain-Computer-Interface

ðŸ§  EEG-Based Brain-Computer Interface Robot Controller ðŸ§  

## Overview

This project aims to build an EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) that allows a human user to control a robot using brain signals alone. The system uses a Raspberry Pi with a PiEEG add-on to record EEG data in real time, trains machine learning models to classify different mental states, and translates these states into control commands for a robot platform.

By continuously collecting and labeling data from users, the BCI model improves over timeâ€”achieving more reliable recognition of intentional mental commands and smoother robot control. This project demonstrates the integration of hardware, signal processing, machine learning, and real-time systems engineering.
